# Races - 1st Data Structures Homework

<!-- NOTES 
- this is written in markdown, so it isn't readable as plain text.
- because I tend to use english variable and function names, I decided to write everything in english, to keep it cohesive (also, I had points taken at a computer programming homework because I had english names for function and romanian comments and readme )
-->

The problem statement can be found [here](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/sd-ca/teme/tema1).
It is basically a athletics championship simulator. More info can be found in the problem statement.

## SkipList

One of the things that needed to be implemented in this project was a skiplist.
A skiplist is a data structure, similar to a B-tree, but a lot easier to implement, which is also faster for most operations.

Basically, skiplist are singly linked list, with "express lanes". These help to `skip` some nodes, making the search a lot faster. As the number of nodes increases, the number of levels increases, making possible even longer "jumps".

### The wrong way to implement a skiplist

![Bad Skiplist](https://i.imgur.com/nNjOtfa.png "Bad Skiplist")

A lot of times, people implement the levels using copies of the original node, each node having 4 pointers (left, right, up, down).

As it was pointed out [here](http://ticki.github.io/blog/skip-lists-done-right/), linking the nodes vertically (and using multiple nodes) leads to some problems:

- Wasted Space
- Cache Misses

### The right way

To solve those problems, the skiplist is implemented using a singly linked list, "in which each node contains an array (representing the nodes above) with pointers to later nodes". Also, because dynamically allocated arrays can still lead to cache misses, the arrays have a fixed size, determined when the node is created.

### Search

The search for a node starts at the beginning of a list(`*first`), on the top level. While the next node on that level is lower than the node searched, the search continues onward. If the next node is equal to the node desired, the search ends. If the next is null, it means the node doesn't exist, and the search ends. If it is higher, you move down a level.
This repeats until a node is found or the level is 0 and the node wasn't found (in this case, it means the node doesn't exist).

### Insert

To insert a node, it is firstly search, to assure it doesn't exist already. After that, the new node is inserted in such a way that the elements are still in ascending order. The number of levels of the new node is determined with a "coin flip" algorithm: while the result is "heads", you generate a new level. This usually has a 50% chance to generate a new level every time. However, the chance can be changed, to increase the time or space complexity.

## CoinFlip

More common randomization algorithms like `rand()` and `srand()`, have some problems, as it was pointed out [here](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/rand-Considered-Harmful) by Stephan T. Lavavej (Visual Studio C++ STL). So, to solve those problems, I used utilities from `random` library. The coin flip could have been implemented just with random device, but it is not very efficient when it need to be called quickly. Random device generates random numbers in the same way as `urandom` does, so it relatively slow.
The coin flip algorithm works this way:

1. Generate a TRUE random number using `random_device`
2. Generate all numbers with a PRNG, that has that true random number used as a seed (`mt19937`)
3. Use a uniform number distribution that produces random numbers only in a closed interval (`uniform_int_distribution<int>`)

## Quicksort

This is an efficient sorting algorithm. The last element in the sequence is chosen as a pivot, then all element on its left that are lower than it are moved to its right. Then, this algorithm is repeated for all elements on its left, respectively right side. At the end, the elements are sorted in descending order. In the next image, the algorithm is used for ascending order sorting.

## Makefile

The essential commands included are:

- `build` - compiles the code and generates the executable ("tema1")
- `run` - compiles, then runs the binary
- `clean` - deletes all binaries and object files

For development and testing purposes, the makefile includes some other commands:

- `beauty` - beautifies the code, using the google standard
- `pack` - creates the archive to be sent to vmchecker
- `update` - downloads and "installs" the checker
- `memory` - checks the program for memory leaks
- `check` - prepares the files required and runs the checker
- `purge` - removes all files that will not be included in the git repository
- `gitignore` - adds unnecessary files to gitignore

The makefile will hide some of the output and show custom messages (for example the "build" command)
